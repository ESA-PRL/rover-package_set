# rover-package_set
Contains all the package sets for the different rovers used in the ESA ESTEC PRL.
Only those packages should be listed here which can be used by ALL rovers.
For specific package sets you have to create a new one because it is not possible to select a branch inside a package set (whereas you can do it for packages!)
